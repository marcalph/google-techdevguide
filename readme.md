# My own tech dev guide

For too long a time I just had a thing for computers and statistics, but in the recent years, as I became a grown up data scientist I've had the chance (sic.) to increasingly spend time working with *real* software engineers.

This is my way of improving myself, picking up on the missing bits to become a more decent programmer.

## Organisation

Each folder corresonds to a particular subject I felt I needed to strenghten at some point.

The foundations folder contains simple problems found in the google tech dev guide under the foundations path.  
The next step was to learn another programming language besides python, I ended up choosing Go, hence the folder.  
On a side note I wanted to improve myself regarding data structures and classical algorithms.
